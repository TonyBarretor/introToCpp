#Binary arithmetics

1 byte = 8 bits

be careful with the fractions, are not precised with the binary system. It gives you something aproximate not exact

IF STATAMENTS

    If you want to put more than 2 lines to be computed, you need curly brackets otherwise without curly brackets it only recognize 1 line that is just 1 statement (thinking if you do it all in one line)

    SWITCH - sometimes is better visual than IF STATEMENTS

    INCREMENT OPERATORS

    when you use ++ as prefix is going to be do it at the execution of the statement. If you do it postfix is going to do it after the execution of the statement.

    DO WHILE - at least execute once, with WHILE checks first if the condition works to execute, if the condition doesnt work it wont execute anything

    FOR LOOPS
        YOu decide how many times is going to work
